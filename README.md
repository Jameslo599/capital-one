learned git more effectively
used MVC architecture with react
implemented router abstraction in backend. got it to work client side through conditional rendering so the initial api call wasnt undefined
It's to know that React runs the callback of an useEffect after all others normal JavaScript codes such as a console.log() and after the JSX is rendered. And even if that wasn't the case, a network request is asynchronous so you get the data after some delay.
i love how in single page apps you can just import css to the root and it will apply to all pages
using finally in the try catch block to make a better ui experience.
using usestate to render different conditions for the user to see.
Practiced building requests and using res.status codes
utilized react portals to implement modal with working z-index functionality.
